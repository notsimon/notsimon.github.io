<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Simon, I was born in 1990 in France and spent most of my childhood on 
an island of the Indian ocean. I currently live in Paris where I work at 
Sevenhugs while doing a PhD thesis on indoor localisation.</p>

<p>I own an Engineering degree in Computer Science and a Master's degree in
Machine Learning. Among other things, my current interests lie around predictive models, 
low-level programming and functionnal languages.</p>
