## Summary

I have an Engineer's degree in Computer Science and a Master's degree in 
Machine Learning, and 5 years of experience as a Software Engineer during which 
I worked on low-level software, machine learning research projects and 
relieable software for production lines. I do my best to be pragmatic about 
problems solving by avoiding dogmas.

## Main skills

Programming &amp; Software Development
:   - Systems: C, C++ and Linux <small>(but my dev station is preferably a Mac)</small>
    - Script: Python

Machine Learning &amp; Optimization
:   - Deep Neural Networks, mainly applied to computer vision
    - Favorite DL framework: PyTorch, for various reasons
    - Linear and non-linear optimization: Kalman filters and its derivatives, SGD, ES

## Work experience

Machine Learning Engineer
:   *[Sevenhugs](https://sevenhugs.com)*, since January 2018

    Work a computer vision algorithm involving deep neural networks, initially 
    a side project done on spare time. This work is subjected to patents 
    submissions and cannot be disclosed further.

Data Fusion & Algorithms Engineer
:   *[Sevenhugs](https://sevenhugs.com)*, from February 2016 to January 2018

    While working on a PhD thesis on indoor SLAM with the magnetic field, in 
    chronological order:

    - Work on a realtime, high-precision geolocation algorithm: implementation 
    of a non-linear Kalman filter for sensors fusion
    - Development of bare-metal drivers for inertial sensors
    - Specification, implementation and deployment on site of the software for 
    manufacturing benches on the production line in China: it combined 
    machine-learning techniques, low-level software as well as a reliable 
    backend to handle and process extracted data.

R&D Software Engineer
:   *[Invoxia](https://invoxia.com)*, from November 2013 to June 2015

    - Development of monitoring tools and acoustic tests for validation of the 
    manufactured hardware during production
    - Review and implementation of sound sources tracking algorithms
    - Low-level software development on a realtime audio processing pipeline: 
    optimization for speed and addition of new codecs in a VoIP stack

Software Engineer Intern
:   *[Thales Communication & Security](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security)*, 
    from March 2013 to August 2013

    Review of the state of the art on fingerprints and iris matching 
    algorithms, applied to border control. Portage and reimplementation of 
    existing programs on GPU. For fingerprints matching: 30x speed increase 
    while reducing the error rate by 25%, for the same cost in hardware.

Teaching Assistant
:   *[EPITA](https://www.epita.fr)*, from September 2010 to June 2011

    Tought laboratory classes of C and OCaml to second-year students.

## Education

    (former *Université Pierre et Marie Curie*), Autumn 2015

    Statistical learning, deep learning, nonclassical logic and reasoning, data 
    mining, information retrieval, artificial intelligence applied to robotic.

Engineering Degree in Computer Science
:   *[EPITA](https://www.epita.fr)*, Graduated in 2013

    - Major in Machine Learning and High Performance Computing
    - Research student at the LRDE.
    - Project examples: physic simulations using GPU, procedural rendering of 
    natural environments, implementation of a compiler, model checking, machine 
    learning, implementation of a shell, parallel and distributed computing.
