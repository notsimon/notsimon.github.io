## Summary

Engineer's degree in Computer Science and Master's degree in
Machine Learning, 5 years of experience as a Software Engineer.

## Skills

Machine Learning &amp; Optimization
:   - Deep Neural Networks, mainly applied to computer vision
    - Favorite DL framework: PyTorch, for various reasons
    - Linear and non-linear optimization, mostly for production chain monitoring and geolocation

Programming &amp; Software Development
:   *Favorite languages and tools*

    - Systems: C, C++ and some assembly, experimenting with Rust
    - Script: Python

Production management
: Foo blah

## Technical work experience

Machine Learning Engineer
:   *@Sevenhugs, since January 2018*

    Started a computer vision project, initially done as a side project on spare
    time. Patent pending.

Data Fusion & Algorithms Engineer
:   *@ Sevenhugs, from February 2016 to January 2018*

    Sensors fusion Kalman filters, low-level sensors drivers
    Production management
    Worked on a PhD thesis on indoor SLAM with the magnetic field
    Started project vision, handled the infrastructure for machine learning work
    Patents

R&D Software Engineer
:   *@ Invoxia, from November 2013 to June 2015*

    I optimized the critical points of the audio processing pipeline: for 
    instance, I increased the speed of the echo canceler by 20%. I reviewed and 
    implemented sound sources tracking algorithms. I developed production 
    monitoring tools and acoustic tests for validation inside our factories. I 
    also added new codecs like Opus in the VoIP stack.

Software Engineer Intern
:   *@ Thales Communication & Security, from March 2013 to August 2013*

    I reviewed the state of the art of fingerprints and iris comparison 
    algorithms for bor- der control and I ported those on GPU. For instance for 
    fingerprints comparison I increased the speed by 30x while reducing the 
    error rate by 25%, all for the same hardware cost.

Teaching Assistant
:   *@ EPITA, from September 2010 to June 2011*

    I teached the laboratory classes of C and OCaml of second-grade students.

## Education

PhD student at *LIP6, Sorbonne University*
:   from September 2016 to November 2017

    \\ TODO

    Supervised by Marie-Jeanne Lesot.
    Indoor SLAM with the magnetic field, differentiable data structures,
    sensors fusion

Master’s Degree in Machine Learning from *Sorbonne University* (former *Université Pierre et Marie Curie*)
:   Autumn 2015

    Statistical learning, deep learning, nonclassical logic and reasoning, data 
    mining, information retrieval, artificial intelligence applied to robotic.

Engineering Degree in Computer Science from EPITA
:   Graduated in 2013

    Major in Machine Learning and High Performance Computing
    Research student at the LRDE.
    Project examples: physic simulations using GPU, procedural rendering of 
    natural environments, implementation of a compiler, model checking, machine 
    learning, implementation of a shell, parallel and distributed computing.
