title: About
---

I live in Nantes, France where I work remotely as a Machine Learning Engineer.

On my spare time I workout a lot, hike and cycle, teach STEM to school children,
try to grow veggies and I love to travel to Asia
<em>with a tiny backpack</em>. These days I also play with
<a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a>.

As I removed myself from most social media, I use these pages as an
authenticated profile â€“ personal as well as professional. This website is
made with [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll), a static pages generator written in
Haskell, and the theme is inspired by [Indigo](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo).
